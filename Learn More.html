                    Elevate your luxury listings with the spotlight they deserve. Single property websites position your listings to make a stunning first impression.
        
        
        
        We all know the saying about first impressions. These days, staging and listing a home don’t just boil down to a few professional photos and some fragrant cleaning products. More than likely, the first glimpses that potential buyers steal of your listings won’t be from a drive-by or a tour—they’ll probably take place online. 
        
        High-end real estate websites pull attention and intrigue to your properties, attracting the buyers you want for your luxury listings.</p>

        <br>Creating property websites sets you and your properties apart from the swipe-based, “onto the next” platforms that keep buyers looking for the next best thing. Instead, impress your sellers when you showcase their listings on a streamlined platform that gives buyers a true feel for the unique draw of the home. 
        
        What is a property website?
        A single property website is just as it sounds—a website dedicated to a specific property that’s listed for sale. It’s a one-stop-shop where potential buyers can find everything they want to know about a home on the market, presented the way you and the seller want it to come across. 
        <br>
        Conglomeration sites like Zillow and top-down sites like MLS platforms can be difficult to navigate and don’t always follow a logical flow of information. Potential buyers can end up swiping right past a listing without even seeing its best features simply because of the way these sites are constructed and organized. With single property websites, you’re in control of what information shines through and the way that it’s organized.</br> 
        
        Understandably, many real estate professionals hear the word “website” and envision hours upon hours of coding work or expensive outsourcing for every property site. In reality, partnering with a professional service makes creating high-end real estate websites attainable and efficient. 
        
        Why create one for each listing?
        From the listing appointment to closing day, single property websites set you apart as an agent who knows the high value of the luxury homes you work to promote. Treating each listing as something special—exactly as you want buyers to see them—communicates your expertise and attention to detail.</br>

            </div>
        </section>
        <div><p>
        <br>As your relationship with a new client progresses, and you’ve got the home out there on the market, your capability to provide needle-sharp analytics and targeted takeaways will not only impress the seller but will also help you understand the market and audience. Once the site is up and running, you’ll have detailed numbers that illustrate how many people are checking out the property, how they’re finding the site, and which pages they’re focusing on. These takeaways become long-term learnings and market research that will benefit your business far beyond that specific listing’s closing.</br>
        
        
        
        Illustrate the Character of Each Listing
        Once you’ve gotten to know each property you’re listing, you can likely put your finger on the main draw of the house. Is it charming? Cozy? Modern? Spacious? 
        
        The true personality of a home simply won’t come across on a stock listing database. Of course, the best way for potential buyers to get familiar with a listing is to come for a tour—but they’ve got to be convinced enough about its potential that they want to spend the time to do that. Especially during the pandemic, making as much information and charisma available online for each listing can mean the difference between obtaining the asking price and twiddling your thumbs for months with no bites. 
        
        Beyond the actual photos and videos you post of your listings and the copy for the listing itself, property websites provide ample opportunities for customization that simply doesn’t arise elsewhere. Everything from fonts and descriptions to easily digestible blurbs and captions plays into a potential buyer’s perception of a property. A property website allows you to feature different photos on each page and create a visually appealing layout that gives buyers a true feel for the house.

        <br>Photos of the inside of the home
        Photos of the outside of the home, including any landscaping features, pools, and fences
        A 3D Tour
        Video walkthroughs
        Well-written descriptions to emphasize special features
        Details about the surrounding area (Are there attractions or landmarks within walking distance? What’s the neighborhood like?)
        Key specs like square footage, lot size, and property history</br>
        
        
        Best practices
        When partnering with a provider to put together property websites for you, double-check that they follow best practices for making the most of the site. 
        
        To optimize return and make your advertising process efficient, there should be an easy way to collect leads straight from your website so that anyone visiting and interested can easily get in touch with you to take the next steps. Also, look for website products with built-in, streamlined analytics reporting so that you can get the full picture of how your site is performing and what you may need to change. 
        
        Since the design of the website needs to reflect your specific listing and unique offerings, be sure to partner with someone who’s designing truly custom, distinguished sites that live up to the homes you list. Look for HD video capabilities and virtual tour integration to be sure that you can properly showcase all of your assets.
